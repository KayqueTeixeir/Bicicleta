        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Bicycles are more than just a means of transportation; they represent a fascinating history of innovation, freedom, and sustainability. From their invention in the 19th century to modern high-tech models, bicycles have played a significant role in people's lives worldwide.</p>
        <p>The history of bicycles dates back to the 19th century when German inventor Karl Drais created the "running machine," a two-wheeled vehicle propelled by the rider's feet. This revolutionary invention paved the way for the development of different types of bicycles over the years.</p>
        <p>Bicycles became a popular mode of transportation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially among the working class. Over time, bicycles evolved, gaining gears, improved brakes, and more aerodynamic designs.</p>
        <p>Today, bicycles are much more than just a way to get around. They are a means of exercise, exploring the great outdoors, and even professional competition. Moreover, bicycles have a positive impact on the environment as an eco-friendly mode of transportation, emitting no pollutants.</p>

        <h1>Function and Composition of Bicycles: Exploring Simple and Efficient Engineering</h1>
        <p>Bicycles are remarkably simple machines that play a significant role in our society as a mode of transportation, sports equipment, and leisure vehicle. Their efficiency and versatility make them popular worldwide. Let's explore the function and composition of bicycles to understand why they are so highly appreciated.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Function of Bicycles:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Bicycles serve multiple functions contributing to their popularity:
            <br><br>
            <b>Sustainable Transportation:</b> They serve as an economical and environmentally friendly means of transportation for urban and rural commutes. Cycling is a healthy and eco-friendly alternative to cars and public transport.<br>
            <b>Physical Exercise:</b> Bicycles provide excellent aerobic exercise, strengthening muscles, and improving cardiovascular health. Regular cycling can help maintain physical fitness and reduce stress.<br>
            <b>Leisure and Recreation:</b> Bicycles are used to explore landscapes, natural trails, and urban areas in a relaxed manner. They enable people to enjoy the outdoors and the freedom of movement.<br>
            <b>Sports Competitions:</b> Cycling is a high-performance sport with various disciplines, including road racing, mountain biking, track cycling, and cyclocross. Professional athletes compete in prestigious events like the Tour de France and the Olympics.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Composition of Bicycles:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Bicycles are precisely designed to meet the specific needs of their various uses. Their basic composition includes:
            <br><br>
            <b>Frame:</b> The bicycle frame is the main structure, usually made of aluminum, steel, carbon, or titanium. It supports all other parts of the bicycle and determines its style and purpose.<br>
            <b>Wheels:</b> Bicycles have two wheels, typically with inflatable rubber tires. Wheel sizes and thickness vary depending on the type of bicycle and its purpose.<br>
            <b>Pedals and Crankset:</b> Pedals are attached to crank arms, which are connected to the central axle. The circular motion of the pedals is transferred to the rear wheel through the chain.<br>
            <b>Chain:</b> The chain is a fundamental component that transmits pedal energy to the rear wheel, propelling the bicycle forward.<br>
            <b>Gears and Gearshift:</b> Many bicycles have a gear system that allows the cyclist to adjust pedal resistance on different terrains. Gearshifts control gear changes.<br>
            <b>Brakes:</b> Brakes are essential for safety. Bicycles can have disc brakes, cantilever brakes, or rim brakes, depending on the type.<br>
            <b>Handlebar and Saddle:</b> The handlebar is used for steering the bicycle, while the saddle provides support to the cyclist. Both can be adjusted for greater comfort and control.<br>
            <b>Additional Components:</b> Depending on the bicycle's purpose, it may have accessories like lights, racks, fenders, water bottle holders, and more.</p>
        <p>The simplicity of the bicycle, combined with its efficient engineering, makes it a versatile and reliable mode of transportation. Its function goes far beyond mere transportation, encompassing sports, leisure, health, and sustainability, making it a true marvel of human engineering.</p>
